I recently read Atomic Habits by James Clear which makes the case for (and provides tips on implementing) continuous "1%" improvements in your daily life. The book provides perspective on building positive habits in small increments. Many people, (including myself) tend to fail because they see habit formation as an all-or-nothing endeavor, while Clear provides some practical methods for making habits stick through things like habit-stacking.
